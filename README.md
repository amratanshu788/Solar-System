# 🌌 Solar System Animation

This project simulates a visual representation of the solar system, with planets revolving around the sun at their respective orbital speeds. Each planet follows its own orbit, and you can hover over the planets to display their names using a tooltip. The project is created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to provide interactive and animated planetary motion.

## 🚀 Features

- **Realistic Orbit Simulation:** Each planet has its own orbit around the sun, with unique speeds to mimic actual planetary motion.
- **Hover Tooltip:** Hover over any planet to reveal its name.
- **Moon Orbit:** Earth's moon orbits around the Earth.
- **Responsive Design:** The solar system adjusts based on the browser window size.
  
## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** Markup for structuring the solar system.
- **CSS3:** Used for animations, planet styling, and positioning the orbits.
- **JavaScript:** Adds interactivity (tooltips) and dynamic behavior.
